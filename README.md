# INSE_6630_Project
Our primary objective revolves around the development of a model adept at precisely recognizing malicious activities, leveraging the widely used KDD CUPâ€™99 dataset. Through a meticulous comparison of diverse machine learning models, our primary emphasis lies in attaining optimal accuracy, with a specific focus on robust recall scores to counteract the potential evasion of detection by fraudulent cyberattacks. This research not only propels the evolution of effective intrusion detection systems but also directly responds to the urgent demand for heightened cybersecurity measures in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
